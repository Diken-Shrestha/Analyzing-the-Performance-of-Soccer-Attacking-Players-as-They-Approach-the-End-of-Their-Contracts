This is my Economic Capstone Research paper. The topic is "Analyzing the Performance of Soccer Attacking Players as They Approach the End of Their Contracts"

## Abstract
The aim of this study is to examine the impact of contracts on the performance of attacking soccer players. It investigates how financial and personal motivations influence on field performance. The sample consists of 136 observations (34 players and 4 years of data for each player) from major European Leagues (Premier League, Serie A, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1) during the season 2017/18 to 2020/21. The dependent variable is performance which is a metric consisting of players in game statistics like goals, assists, shots, dribbles and passes. The main independent variable is contract time remaining, which measures how many years or season a player has on their contract followed by control variables age, minutes played and discipline (fouls committed). The model uses multiple linear regression that uses fixed effects which controls for individual characteristics that do not change over time (like player talent) by including entity (player) effects. The results from the main model showed that players perform better in their final years of the contract. The findings provide valuable insights for clubs, agents, and players in structuring contracts and making informed decisions on player retention. Understanding these performance trends can help clubs optimize contract lengths and incentives, ensuring sustained contributions from their players.
